# Advent of Code 2023 - rpvdpnl's Python Challenge

Hey everyone, welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository. I'm rpvdpnl, and this is my first crack at AoC. I'm tackling it with Python, and I'm excited to see how it goes.

## About AoC
Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge during December. It's a series of fun, sometimes tricky, puzzles that really get your brain working. Perfect for anyone looking to brush up their coding skills.

## This Repo's Setup
**For every year:**
- **admin/**: Scripts for the behind-the-scenes stuff, like fetching puzzle descriptions.
- **days/**: Each day's challenge is neatly packed in its own folder, like `day1/`, `day2/`, and so on.
- **tests/**: Here's where I make sure everything's working as it should.
- **utils.py**: A collection of handy functions I use across different parts of the project.
- **venv**: changed `bin/activate`, `$PYTHONPATH` = ../../ (Root of repo)

## Setup a new year
Run `python3 setup_new_year.py` and follow the prompt in CLI to setup the file structure of a new year.

## Feel Free to Explore
Whether you're also doing AoC, just into Python, or curious about different problem-solving approaches, you're welcome to check out my solutions. 

## Feedback and Thoughts
Open to any feedback, suggestions, or tips you might have. It's all about learning and improving, so your thoughts are highly appreciated.
